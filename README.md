COVID 19 has been an eye-opener and has proved to us that majority of us don't prioritize our health. But why? that's because of the lack of resources and relevant information. The information which is precise, easy to understand, and all in one place without hunting down the web.
 
The health sector has always been a concern for India. But the most severely affected domains are - Mental health, menstruation, Pregnancy, and Nutrition. This is because of the unawareness and taboo surrounding these matters.

According to WHO, around 450 million people currently suffer from Mental illness, and yet as a society, we are oblivious of these risks and how to deal with them.

It isn't a secret that many girls drop out of school when they hit puberty. This is because they don't have access to the required resources and they are made to feel embarrassed about it.

The National health portal of India mentions the Lack of Maternal Health as one of the major problems in our country. Most of these issues are due to a lack of appropriate care during pregnancy and childbirth.

Nutrition is a critical part of health and development. Yet still, more than one-third of the world's malnourished children live in India and a third of the wealthiest children are over-nutriented, according to Wikipedia. This includes a wide range of problems from malnutrition to obesity. The most challenging part is loads of misinformation on this topic.

That is what our app Stree aims to solve. Stree is an app for any help you may need for your overall wellbeing. 

All these issues are due to some common obstacles. Firstly lack of correct information, Secondly lack of access to the required resources.

To address the first issue, on our app we will provide basic information about these domains. Explaining the basic guidelines like what does it mean, what may be the symptoms, why it happens, what precautions to take. All the information will be certified by the Medical Experts in that domain.

And Lastly to decrease the taboo about the subject we have a platform where you can also share your experiences and difficulties with others anonymously. It will help us to talk about these issues more openly and remove the taboo surrounding it.

We will have some additionals features like period tracking which will also help us customize your notification and provide you information relevant to you. We will also include the General fitness domain as people often neglect their health saying that is they are free from the illness they don't need to look after themselves.
